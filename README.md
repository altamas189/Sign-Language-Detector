# 🧏 Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

A computer vision project that detects sign language hand gestures and classifies them using a Random Forest model trained on custom gesture data.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To bridge communication gaps for the hearing- and speech-impaired by recognizing hand gestures representing alphabets and commands in real-time.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- OpenCV (Image Processing)  
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)  
- NumPy & Pandas

## 📁 Dataset

The model was trained on a **custom image dataset** captured using a webcam. Each image represents a hand gesture for a specific letter or symbol.
